# DOT NYC - Bike Racks Mapping and Dashboard


### Description

The DOT required an interactive map and dashboard which will use NYC Open data set for City bike racks and will display it on the map accordingly through Leaflet.JS and React. It will also provide the user with option to report an issue to DOT within the map. The motivation for the project was to provide an alternative to current City Rack map viewer which required userâ€™s to navigate to a different site and to use ARTS for reporting an issue.

### App Evaluation

- **Market:** DOT and anyone who has acess to the website.
